		<h1>Galaxy <span>S8</span>  and <span>S8+</span></h1>
		<p>
		Immerse yourself in a bigger view that still fits comfortably in your hand. Galaxy S8 and S8+ break free from the confines of bezels, offering a smooth, uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges. To do this, we completely redesigned the phone from the inside out. And we embedded the home button under the screen, where it stays hidden until you need it. So you get a bigger, unobstructed view without a larger phone.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Infinity Display sets a new standard for uninterrupted, immersive experiences. It enables an expanded screen size without necessitating a larger phone. So while the view is grander, Galaxy S8 and S8+ feel small in your hand, making them easy to hold and use.

We've got a huge selection from the world's leading brands, from ultra-thin HTCs to sleek Samsungs and intelligent iPhones.

						Our fantastic selection means that we have the perfect model for social media addicts, movie moguls or happy snappers. If you love capturing your fave moments on camera, try a mobile with an impressive 8 megapixel camera to take your Instagram profile up a notch with some high-definition snaps. For multimedia fans, a 32GB phone is the way to go. With plenty of room to store the latest blockbusters, top hits and boredom-busting games, your commute to work will never be the same again. If you need speedy access to emails and documents on the go, pick up one of our amazing 4G-ready handsets – buffering will be a thing of the past.

			<h2>Make a Style Statement</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="./image/Small2.png"> Many of the mobiles in our range perform just as well in the style stakes. Choose from a huge selection of stylish colours, from metallics – futuristic chrome, glam gold or shimmering silver – to fun shades like green, blue and orange. Our 8mm mobile phones are even slim enough to slip into a clutch bag on a night out. If you fancy customising your handset, take your pick from our phone accessories. Cases from Ted Baker, Accessorize and Adidas lead the way, while designs from brands like LEGO are great for kids' (or grown-up kids') phones.
